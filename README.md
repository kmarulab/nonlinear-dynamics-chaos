# ENGR 091 - Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos
## Spring 2025 - Swarthmore College
This course will introduce students to the exciting field of nonlinear dynamics and chaos, with an emphasis on its applications in the sciences broadly and in engineering specifically. Emphasis will be placed on the interpretation and analysis of the behavior of systems governed by nonlinear differential equations, including but not limited to mechanical, electrical, biological, chemical and social processes. Topics will include fixed points, stability, potentials, bifurcations, and the phase plane. Chaos will be introduced in a mathematically rigorous way, and students will learn how to quantify and interpret chaos – as opposed to randomness – when it occurs in systems of engineering and scientific interest.
